If a key is an table name, then $from is not needed. Otherwise $from is needed.
The table name (from a $from if existing, otherwise from the key name) determines the columns.

1. Generate a $ref for the case where a $from is provided for each table, and another for each table without $from
  + default JSON schema, so more compatible
  - effectively doubles the schema size
  - cant really modify schema anymore since there is code duplication between the refs
2. Use a $data, which supports relative ref or $merge and $patch which can combine a $from schema with a base table schema
  + no code duplication
  - not standard JSON Schema syntax, only with ajv
  - Good luck parsing the schema (e.g. docs generation)
3. Eject from the schema (i.e. validate all $from, columns etc against all tables and all columns)
  + simplest schema, no wierd hacks
  - alot of the validation must be done in js
4. Remove the $from inference macro
  + schema will be much simpler to implement with no duplication (using simple $ref for recursion)
  + simplify schema for less code and easier to parse for external tooling
  - makes queries more verbose (have to have $from even if its obvious where it should take from)\
  ? what about columns, should { id: true } be disallowed to force { id: 'id' } ?
