## Orma
Update read format,
----------ðŸš§ THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§----------

Orma is a declarative, syncronous, dependency free ORM.

Orma provides introspection, validation, query construction and mutations. 
The package uses json format to represent sql queries and mutations.

When the database is instrospected a declarative schema is generated as a json object.
Typescript types are also generated. 

The orma schema can be diffed by the user and validated using runtime schema validation functions.

To construct orma queries, pass a json object with columns to include or subqueries similar to graphql. Reserved sql keywords can be accessed with the $ prefix and snake case. (eg $group_by, $limit, $where)

To construct orma mutations, pass a json object with nested objects and the schema. Orma
will use a single pass toposort algorithm to decompose into the minimum number of batch
insert requests and run them in parallel ensuring parents get created before children,
and foreign key references are inserted into children tables.

Key Advantages


Disadvantages
Supports sql databases only


## Installation
```
npm i orma  // Or yarn add orma
```

## Intospect a mysql database
This is where we describe what introspection means
What is the syntax
What are the limitations

```js
import { ... } from 'orma'
// here is a code snippet
```
## Construct queries
The query generates nested json by...
```js
// This is how you construct queries
// This is how you execute queries
```

## Construct Mutations
Mutation format is the same as from the read uil...
Operations are nested in as meta on each level...
Here is where we explain what recursive op hierarchy alternative to graphql
```js
// Another snippet
```

## Examples

```js
// How to run a long lived transaction
```

```js
// How to batch insert nested tables
```

```js
// How to query for table1 where table2 matches a criteria
```

```js
// How to query all table1 including table2 when table2 matches a criteria
```

```js
// How to use any/all for hierarcy queries eg permissions
```

```js
// How to use $op cascading
```
