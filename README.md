# What is Orma?

Orma is a JSON-based, statically typed query language for SQL databases.

Orma provides the tools to secure and simplify your database queries, while still exposing the full power of SQL.

Key Features

üí™ Powerful
- Nested queries and mutations
- Mixed operations (create, update and delete in one request)
- Extensive SQL-based syntax
- Automatic typescript for queries and mutations

üõπ Portable
- Pure JS with no code generation
- BYO database connector

üï• Performant
- All SQL statements are batched
- Query plans for maximum parallelization

Orma also helps with validation, sql injection protection, while leaving the rest of the database management to the programmer. The programmer will be responsible for providing a configured connection pool so that sql strings can get executed.

## Getting started

Try out the Interactive playground
https://orma-playground.web.app/

Install orma as well as your favorite database adapter

```
npm i orma
npm i pg
(or npm i mysql2)
```

## Database connector

Orma is not opinionated on database connectors, so feel free to use your favourite one. The examples here will use [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2). To use a different connector, a small wrapper may need to be written. This is relatively straightforward to implement, please check the [source code](src/helpers/database_adapters.ts) for details on what the wrapper needs to do.

Example setup:

```typescript
import mysql from 'mysql2'
import { mysql2_adapter } from 'orma'

const pool = mysql
    .createPool({
        host: env.host,
        port: env.port,
        user: env.user,
        password: env.password,
        database: env.database,
        multipleStatements: true,
    })
    .promise()

const orma_sql_function = mysql2_adapter(pool)
```

## Orma Schema

The orma schema is a JSON object that is required when making queries or mutations. The schema contains entity names, column names, as well as foreign key references and uniqness constraints and can be introspected directly by reading a live database or written manually. The schema is regular, serializable JSON, so it can be created dynamically at runtime, or fetched via an HTTP request. However, it is recommended to save the schema to disk so that Orma can provide intellisense through its Typescript types.

### Automatic Introspection

While Orma schemas can be hand-written, there is currently no way to populate a database with an orma schema. Instead, a schema can be introspected from an existing database which can be managed through other tools such as [db-migrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/db-migrate). To get intellisense, the schema must be saved to a .ts file with 'as const' at the end.

The following is an example of a mysql database being introspected:

```js
const orma_schema = await orma_introspect('database_name', orma_sql_function, {
    database_type: 'mysql',
})

const orma_schema_string = `export const orma_schema = ${JSON.stringify(
    orma_schema,
    null,
    2
)} as const`

writeFileSync('./orma_schema.ts', orma_schema_string)
```

The generated schema JSON will look something like this:

```js
// {
//     "users": {
//         "id": {
//           "data_type": "bigint",
//           "not_null": true,
//           "primary_key": true,
//         },
//         "email": {
//             "data_type": "character varying",
//           "not_null": true,
//           "character_count": 10485760
//         },
//         "first_name": {
//           "data_type": "character varying",
//           "ordinal_position": 4,
//           "character_count": 10485760
//         },
//         ...
//     }
//     ...
// }
```

# Queries

## Setup

Queries are executed though the orma_query function:

```js
import { orma_query, validate_query } from 'orma'

const query = {
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
    },
}

const validation_errors = validate_query(query, orma_schema)

const results = await orma_query(query, orma_schema, orma_sql_function)

// {
//     users: [{
//         id: 1,
//         first_name: 'Alice',
//     }, {
//         id: 2,
//         first_name: 'Bob',
//     }, ...]
// }
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If Orma is being exposed via a public-facing API, it is imperative that queries be validated with the validate_query function. This is because validation ensures that every element in the query is either from a known list of values (e.g. keywords, field and entity names) or properly sanitized (e.g. escaping in $where clauses). In other words, <b>queries that include user input and are not validated are vulnerable to SQL injection</b>.

## Structure

Orma queries are serializable JSON objects that represent sql queries and are used to fetch data from a database. Queries are made up of properties that:

1. Start with '$'. These are keywords and will not appear in the query response
2. Start with anything else. These are data props and will appear in the response

In the following example, users and posts entities exist. The posts entity has a foreign key, user_id, which references users. Since there is only one foreign key, Orma automatically infers the correct foreign key for nesting.

<table>
<tr>
<th> Query </th> <th> Response </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
        last_name: true,
        posts: {
            id: true,
            views: true
        },
    },
}
```

</td>
<td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1,
        first_name: 'Alice',
        last_name: 'Anderson',
        posts: [{ id: 10, views: 109 }]
    }, {
        id: 2,
        first_name: 'Bob',
        last_name: 'Brown',
        posts: [{ id: 20, views: 87 }]
    }]
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Nested queries like the one above are called subqueries. Subqueries can also be nested in reverse:

<table>
<tr>
<th> Query </th> <th> Response </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
{
    posts: {
        id: true,
        views: true,
        users: {
            id: true,
            first_name: true,
        }
    },
}
```

</td>
<td>
    
```js
{
    posts: [{
        id: 10, 
        views: 109,
        users: [{ id: 1, first_name: 'Alice', }]
    }, {
        id: 20, 
        views: 87,
        users: [{ id: 1, first_name: 'Bob', }]
    }]
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Recall that the JSON properties in the result must exactly match the JSON properties in the query. By changing the property names in the query, fields and entities in the response can be renamed. Note the added $from keyword in the posts subquery, which tells orma which entity to fetch the posts from:

<table>
<tr>
<th> Query </th> <th> Response </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
{
    users: {
        cool_id: 'id',
        first_name: true,
        my_posts: {
            $from: 'posts',
            id: true
        },
    },
}
```

</td>
<td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        cool_id: 1,
        first_name: 'Alice',
        my_posts: [{ id: 10 }]
    }]
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

In some cases, Orma can't figure out the correct foreign key. For example, if the users entity has both a billing_address_id and shipping_address_id that reference an addresses entity, then nesting addresses onto users is ambiguous. In this case the $foreign_key keyword can be used to choose a foreign key, and the entities can be renamed so that they can both exist on the same result object. Note that $foreign_key should always be on the more deeply nested entity, in this case addresses.

<table>
<tr>
<th> Query </th> <th> Response </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
        billing_addresses: {
            $foreign_key: ['billing_address_id'],
            $from: 'addresses',
            line_1: true
        },
        shipping_addresses: {
            $foreign_key: ['shipping_address_id'],
            $from: 'addresses',
            line_1: true
        }
    },
}
```

</td>
<td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1,
        first_name: 'Alice',
        billing_addresses: [{ line_1: '1 Test Road' }],
        shipping_addresses: [{ line_1: '2 Data Lane' }]
    }]
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### SQL functions

Orma supports functions to transform data, for example:

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Result </th></tr><tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        capitalized_first_name: {
            $upper: 'first_name'
        }
    },
}
```

</td><td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1,
        capitalized_first_name: 'ALICE'
    }]
}
```

</td></tr></table>

A full list of currently supported functions can be found in the sql_function_definitions variable in the [source code](src/query/json_sql.ts).

## Pagination

Pagination is done though the $limit and $offset keywords, which work the same as in standard SQL. This example will return only 1 result, starting from the second record of users:

<table>
<tr>
<th> Query </th> <th> Response </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
        $limit: 1,
        $offset: 1
    },
}
```

</td>
<td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1,
        first_name: 'Bob'
    }]
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è because Orma fetches all data in batch, pagination on subqueries applies to ALL records for that subquery, as opposed to applying once per record in the higher query. For example, the following query will fetch one post for <b>all</b> users, as opposed to one post <b>per</b> user as you might expect.

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Response </th></tr><tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
        posts: {
            id: true,
            $limit: 1
        }
    },
}
```

</td><td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1,
        first_name: 'Alice',
        posts: [{ id: 1 }]
    }, {
        id: 2,
        first_name: 'Bob'
        // Even though Bob has posts, they are not fetched because 1 post was already fetched for Alice
    }]
}
```

</td></tr></table>

## Filtering

Results can be filtered using the $where keyword. The following example returns users with the name 'Alice', notice the use of the $escape keyword, which tells Orma to interpret 'Alice' as a value instead of a field name. Specifically, $escape wraps the value in quotes (if it is a string) and escapes any unsafe SQL characters, such as ' characters:

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Response </th></tr><tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
        $where: {
            $eq: ['first_name', {
                $escape: 'Alice'
            }]
        }
    },
}
```

</td><td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1,
        first_name: 'Alice'
    }]
}
```

</td></tr></table>

### Filtering operations

Other filter operations are also available:

<table><tr><th> $where clause </th> <th> Generated SQL </th></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$eq: ['column_1', 'column_2']
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 = column_2
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$eq: ['column_1', { $escape: null }]
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 IS NULL
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$gt: ['column_1', 'column_2']
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 > column_2
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$lt: ['column_1', 'column_2']
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 < column_2
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$gte: ['column_1', 'column_2']
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 >= column_2
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$lte: ['column_1', 'column_2']
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 <= column_2
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$like: ['column_1', { $escape: '%search_phrase%' }]
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 LIKE '%search_phrase%'
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
$in: ['column_1', { $escape: [1, 2] }]
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 IN (1, 2)
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
// $not works with most other search keywords. For example:
$not: {
    $eq: ['column_1', 'column_2']
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 != column_2
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
// $not works with most other search keywords. For example:
$not: {
    $in: ['column_1', { $escape: [1, 2] }]
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
column_1 NOT IN (1, 2)
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
// $not works with most other search keywords. For example:
$not: {
    $gt: ['column_1', 'column_2']
}
```

</td></tr>
</table>

### Connectives

The $and and $or keywords can be used to combine multiple $where clauses together, and can be nested to achieve complex filtering. For example, the following query will fetch all users who either have a first name starting with 'B' or are named Alice Anderson:

<table><tr><th> Query </th><th> Generated SQL </th></tr><tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        first_name: true,
        $where: {
            $or: [{
                $and: [{
                    $eq: ['first_name', { $escape: 'Alice'}]
                }, {
                    $eq: ['last_name', { $escape: 'Anderson'}]
                }]
            }, {
                $like: ['name', { $escape: 'B%' }]
            }]
        }
    },
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM users
WHERE (first_name = 'Alice' AND last_name = 'Anderson') OR (id LIKE 'B%')
```

</td></tr></table>

### Any path

Sometimes you want to search for some record based on the existence of some other record. For example, we can find all users who had at least one of their posts commented on by the user 'Bob'. Nesting posts and comments is not necessary for $any_path to work, and is only done here for demonstration purposes:

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Response </th><th> Generated SQL (for users) </th></tr><tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        first_name: true,
        posts: {
            id: true,
            comments: {
                body: true,
                users: {
                    first_name: true
                }
            }
        },
        $where: {
            $any_path: [['posts', 'comments', 'users'], {
                // this object is a $where clause on the 'users' entity, since 'users' is the last entity in the $any_path
                $eq: ['first_name', { $escape: 'Bob' }]
            }]
        }
    },
}
```

</td><td>
    
```js
{
    // only Alice's user is returned, since only Alice has a post that was commented on by Bob
    users: [{
        first_name: 'Alice',
        posts: [{ 
            id: 1,
            comments: [{
                body: 'Interesting post Alice!',
                users: [{
                    first_name: 'Bob'
                }]
            }]
        }]
    }]
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM users WHERE id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM posts WHERE id IN (
        SELECT post_id FROM comments WHERE user_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM users WHERE first_name = 'Bob'
        )
    )
)
```

</td></tr></table>

### Subqueries in $where clauses

Like in regular SQL, Orma allows subqueries inside where clauses. These can be used instead of $any_path, to handle more complicated use cases - $any_path is simply a utility provided by Orma to generate a series of these nested subqueries:

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Response </th><th> Generated SQL (for users) </th></tr><tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        first_name: true,
        posts: {
            id: true
        },
        $where: {
            $in: ['id', {
                $select: ['user_id'],
                $from: 'posts',
                $where: {
                    $eq: ['id', { $escape: 1}]
                }
            }]
        }
    },
}
```

</td><td>
    
```js
{
    // The user that has a post with id 1 is returned (Alice in this case)
    users: [{
        first_name: 'Alice',
        posts: [{ 
            id: 1,
        }]
    }]
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM users WHERE id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM posts WHERE id = 1
)
```

</td></tr></table>

### Self reference

As seen in previous examples, operations can be done to compare columns, as they can be in raw SQL. In cases where both an entity name and a field name must be given, the $entity $field syntax can be used. This can be necessary if, for example, a field in a subquery should be equal to another field in the higher query.

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Generated SQL </th></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    $eq: ['first_name', 'last_name']
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
first_name = last_name
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    $eq: [
        'first_name',
        {
            $entity: 'posts',
            $field: 'id',
        },
    ]
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
first_name = posts.id
```

</td></tr>
</table>

## Grouping and ordering

The $group_by and $order_by keywords work the same as GROUP BY and ORDER BY in SQL. Ordering can be done using $asc or $desc. $group_by allows aggregate functions such as $sum to be used. For example:

<table><tr><th> Query </th> <th> Result </th></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    users: {
        id: true,
        $order_by: [{ $desc: 'id' }]
    }
}
```

</td><td>
    
```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 2
    }, {
        id: 1
    }]
}
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    posts: {
        user_id: true,
        total_views: {
            $sum: 'views'
        },
        $group_by: ['user_id']
    }
}
```

</td><td>
    
```sql
posts: [{
    user_id: 1,
    total_views: 152
}, {
    user_id: 2,
    total_views: 439
}]
```

</td></tr>
</table>

# Mutations

Mutations provide a way to modify data through three $operations: create, update and delete.

## Mutation diffs

The simplest way to generate a mutation is by fetching data, modifying it and using Orma's get_mutation_diff function to automatically generate a mutation. The clone() function used is a deep clone, which can be found in most utility libraries such as [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#cloneDeep) or [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#clone):

```js
import { get_mutation_diff, orma_query, orma_mutate } from 'orma'

const query = {
    users: {
        id: true,
        first_name: true,
        last_name: true,
    },
}

const original = await orma_query(query, orma_schema, orma_sql_function)
// {
//     users: [{
//         id: 1,
//         first_name: 'Alice',
//         last_name: 'Anderson'
//     }]
// }

const modified = clone(original)
modified.users[0].last_name = 'Smith'

const mutation_diff = get_mutation_diff(original, modified)
// mutation_diff is
// {
//     users: [{
//         $operation: 'update',
//         id: 1,
//         last_name: 'Smith'
//     }]
// }

await orma_mutate(mutation_diff, orma_sql_function, orma_schema)

// Now Alice's last_name is 'Smith'
```

To create or add data this way, simply add a record to the users array (with no id field) or delete a user (using javascript's .splice() method). Additionally, get_mutation_diff can handle creating, updating, or deleteing nested entities, or even adding new entities that were not in the original data (these will always be creates).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è get_mutation_diff only works with entities that have a single-field primary key named '**id**' selected in the query.

## Operations

Mutations can also be created using the $operation keyword. Operations can be combined to do multiple things in the same mutation. For example:

<table><tr><th> Mutation </th> <th> Effect </th></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    users: [{
        $operation: 'create',

            }]
        }
    ]
}
```

</td><td>
Create a new user for Charlie, and create a post. Orma will automatically set the user_id of this post to whatever id the database generated for Charlie. This works because there is only one foreign key (user_id) connecting the users and posts tables.

</td></tr>
</table>

Notice that in the last example, we did not need a $operation on the post - Orma inferred that this is a create through [operation cascading](#operation-cascading).

## Operation cascading

It can be cumbersome to write an operation on each record (especially when creating mutations by hand), which is why Orma provides operation cascading. This means that a record with no $operation will inherit an operation from the closest ancestor record above it. In addition to regular operations cascading, a root operation can be provided to cascade onto top-level records (besides for cascading, root operations don't do anything). For example:

```js
{
    $operation: 'update',
    users: [{
        // $operation is inherited as an 'update'
        id: 1,
        last_name: 'Smith',
        posts: [{
            // $operation is inherited as an 'update'
            id: 2,
            views: 123
        }, {
            // $operation cascading is overriden by providing an operation
            $operation: 'create',
            title: 'My post'
        }]
    }]
}
```

## Record identifiers

When updating or deleting, Orma will choose one or more fields to act as the **record identifier**. These fields determine which record in the database will be modified. In the case of updates, the value of record identifiers will never be changed. Record identifiers are chosen in this order:
1. primary key(s)
2. unique field(s)

Primary keys or unique indexes with more than one field are supported. If the choice is ambiguous, then the mutation is invalid (for example, two fields belonging to different unique indexes are given, but no primary key is provided). Note that fields that have a $guid as their value are *not* considered when chosing a record identifier.

Since primary keys are always chosen to be the record identifier if they are present, it is currently impossible to change a primary key via a mutation. 

<table><tr><th> Mutation piece </th> <th> Record identifiers </th><th> Fields that are updated </th></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    $operation: 'update',
    id: 1,
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Smith'
}
```

</td><td>
id

    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Smith'
}
```

</td><td>
email
</td>
</td><td>
first_name, last_name
</td></tr>
</table>

## Creating in batch

All create operations are done in batches for efficiency. In other words, one CREATE statement is generated with many records from a single entity. To determine auto-generated ids, Orma requires that all the fields from at least one unique index is provided in the mutation. For example:

<table><tr><th> Mutation piece </th> <th> Valid </th></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    $operation: 'create',
    id: 1,
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Smith'
}
```

</td><td>
‚úÖ Yes, primary key is provided
</td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    $operation: 'create',
    email: 'john@smith.com'
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Smith'
}
```

</td><td>
‚úÖ Yes, unique field 'email' is provided
</td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```js
{
    $operation: 'create',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Smith'
}
```

</td><td>
‚ùå No, no unique field provided
</td>
</td></tr>
</table>

If there are entities that have no required unique fields, a temporary_id column with a unique index can be added. In the following example, a temporary_id column has been added to every table in the database. The temporary id is randomly generated using [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) before the mutation runs:

```js
import {
    orma_mutate_prepare, 
    orma_mutate_run
} from 'orma'

import { nanoid } from 'nanoid'

const mutation = { 
    $operation: 'update',
    addresses: { id: 1, line_1: '123 Road' }
}

const mutation_plan = orma_mutate_prepare(orma_schema, mutation)

mutation_plan.mutation_pieces.forEach(mutation_piece => {
    if (mutation_piece.record.$operation === 'create') {
        mutation_piece.record.temporary_id = nanoid()
    }
})

await orma_mutate_run(
    orma_schema,
    orma_sql_function,
    mutation_plan,
    mutation
)
```

In the previous example, orma_mutate_prepare and orma_mutate_run were used instead of orma_mutate, allowing custom logic to happen in between.

## Guids

Just like foreign keys in queries, mutations rely on inference to automatically insert foreign keys when creating records. The $guid keyword provides a way to customize this behaviour by specifying that two or more fields should end up with the same value. This can be used to control foreign key insertion even in cases where there are multiple foreign keys or for records that are not adjacent in the mutation. 
In the first example, Orma cannot automatically infer a foreign key value, since the records are not nested together in the mutation.
In the second example, $guids are used to specify which address is the billing address and which one is the shipping address. Orma can't infer which foreign key to use automatically, since there are two foreign keys to choose from: billing_address_id and shipping_address_id.

            line_2: '11 Data Lane'
        }]
    }]
}
```

</table>
$guid values can be any strings or numbers. In these examples, a short random string was used to keep the examples simple. However, to avoid collisions between guids, it is recommended that a longer random string or some unique piece of data be used.

# Multitenancy

## Connection edges
Orma supports [multitenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) using a concept of **connected records**. Records are connected if there is a path between them following a given list of **edges** (directed foreign keys). Orma provides a function to generate one edge per foreign key, from the foreign key to the referenced field. This covers most multitenancy use cases:

```js
import { get_upwards_connection_edges } from 'orma'

const connection_edges = get_upwards_connection_edges(orma_schema)
```

To figure out which records are connected to a source record, we follow the connection edges. For example, say we wanted to find all the comments connected to the user with id 1, using the default connection edges generated above. We would first find all the connected posts (all the posts with user_id 1) and then find all the connected comments (all the comments with a post_id that references a connected post).

<table><tr><th> Distance from users </th> <th> Connected records </th></tr>
<tr><td>
0
</td><td>

```js
{
    users: [{
        id: 1
    }]
}
```
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
1
</td><td>

```js
{
    posts: [{
        id: 10,
        user_id: 1
    }, {
        id: 11,
        user_id: 1
    }]
}
```
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
2
</td><td>

```js
{
    comments: [{
        id: 100,
        post_id: 10
    }, {
        id: 101,
        post_id: 10
    }, {
        id: 110,
        post_id: 11
    }]
}
```
</td></tr>
</table>

All the users, posts and comments listed above are connected to the user with id 1.

With this in mind, Orma provides two main functions for dealing with connected edges. Given one or more source records:
1. The $where_connected keyword automatically filteres everything in the query to only include records connected to the source records
2. The get_mutation_connected_errors function returns errors if anything in the mutation is not connected to the source records

Here is an example usage of each one:

```js
import { 
    orma_query, 
    orma_mutate_prepare, 
    get_mutation_connected_errors, 
    orma_mutate_run
} from 'orma'

// query example. Only addresses with the user_id 1 are returned
const results = await orma_query(
    { 
        $where_connected: [{
            $entity: 'users',
            $field: 'id',
            $values: [1]
        }],
        addresses: { id: true }
    },
    orma_schema,
    orma_sql_function,
    connection_edges
)

// mutation example. Since address 1 has the user_id 1, the mutation is valid and the errors array is empty
const mutation = { 
    $operation: 'update',
    addresses: { id: 1, line_1: '123 Road' }
}
const mutation_plan = orma_mutate_prepare(orma_schema, mutation)
const errors = await get_mutation_connected_errors(
    orma_schema,
    connection_edges,
    orma_sql_function,
    [
        {
            $entity: 'users',
            $field: 'id',
            $values: [1],
        },
    ],
    mutation_plan.mutation_pieces
)

if (connected_errors.length > 0) {
    // handle invalid mutation
}

await orma_mutate_run(
    orma_schema,
    orma_sql_function,
    mutation_plan,
    mutation
)
```

In the previous example, orma_mutate_prepare and orma_mutate_run were used instead of orma_mutate, allowing the get_connected_errors function to run in between.

## Restricting $where_connected

To ensure a $where_connected is present, the restrict_where_connected function can be used. This function takes the maximal set of records that a query should have access to - you can still pass a smaller subset of those records into the query's $where_connected. If any non-allowed records are passed, the function will generate an error. For example, imagine an admin has access to records connected to user 1 and 2:

```js
const maximal_where_connected = [{
    $entity: 'users',
    $field: 'id',
    $values: [1, 2] // has access to user 1 and 2
}]
```

Example where a valid $where_connected is provided

```js
const query = {
    $where_connected: [{
        $entity: 'users',
        $field: 'id',
        $values: [1] // requests records connected to user 1, which is a subset of 1 and 2
    }],
    addresses: { id: true }
}

// the errors array is empty
const errors = restrict_where_connected(query, maximal_where_connected)

if (errors.length > 0) {
    // handle invalid query
}
```

Example where no $where_connected is provided

```js
const query = {
    addresses: { id: true }
}

// since no $where_connected is provided in the query, there are no errors
const errors = restrict_where_connected(query, maximal_where_connected)

if (errors.length > 0) {
    // handle invalid query
}

// query.$where_connected is now equal to maximal_where_connected. If we ran the query, addresses from users 1 and 2 would be returned
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è if no $where_connected is provided, restrict_where_connected will mutate the input query.

## Setting connection edges

Connection edges can be added, removed or reversed to cover more use cases. For example, imagine we wanted posts to be public, so that any user can query posts from any other user. We could do this by removing the connection edge between users and posts (we would ony pass this into the query function, so that users can't edit posts from other users):

```js
import { get_upwards_connection_edges, remove_connection_edges } from 'orma'

const default_connection_edges = get_upwards_connection_edges(orma_schema)

const connection_edges = remove_connection_edges(default_connection_edges, [{
    from_entity: 'posts',
    from_field: 'user_id',
    to_entity: 'users',
    to_field: 'id'
}])
```

We can also reverse connection edges. For example, imagine we had a post_groupings table and each post had an optional post_grouping_id that referenced a post_groupings id. By default, the connection edge would go from the post to the post grouping. This means that a post_grouping has no connection path to the users table, and so any user can edit any post grouping. If we want users to only have access to post groupings that their posts are part of, we can reverse the connection edge:

```js
import { 
    get_upwards_connection_edges, 
    add_connection_edges, 
    remove_connection_edges, 
    Edge, 
    reverse_edges 
} from 'orma'

const default_connection_edges = get_upwards_connection_edges(orma_schema)

const add_edges: Edge[] = [
    {
        from_entity: 'post_groupings',
        from_field: 'id',
        to_entity: 'posts',
        to_field: 'post_grouping_id',
    }
]

const remove_edges: Edge[] = [
    // other edges can also be removed here
    ...add_edges.map(edge => reverse_edge(edge))
]

const connection_edges = add_connection_edges(
    remove_connection_edges(default_connection_edges, remove_edges),
    add_edges
)
```

# Advanced use cases

## Custom SQL

For internal use, Orma allows custom sql strings for features that do not yet have an Orma syntax. To do this, simply include an SQL string and skip validation:

```js
import { orma_query } from 'orma'

const results = await orma_query({
    users: {
        id: true,
        $where: "first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Smith'"
    }
})
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom SQL is provided as a last resort and is not well supported by Orma. Any custom SQL should be tested before use. Additionally, custom SQL will not always work well with other Orma features such as $where_connected.
